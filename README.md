## Description

_TravelAPI is an API used to track reviews for travel destinations around the world. The starting database is seeded with data for 20 reviews but the API supports full CRUD functionality to store additional reviews and to edit and delete existing ones. Reviews are queryable by destination, city, country, user, and rating. TravelApi v2 also supports pagination and querying results by page number and page size. This project was built using C#, Entity Framework Core, and MySQL._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Download project repository from GH to your local machine._
* _Clone this repository to your desktop._
* _Open your shell (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory at ```./TravelAPi.Solution/TravelApi/```._

#### To Configure and Access the Database:
* _Within the production directory "TravelApi", create a new file called ``appsettings.json``._
* _Within ```appsettings.json```, put the following code, replacing the "uid" and "pwd" values (in the brackets below) with your own username and password for MySQL. Also replace the "database" value with your desired database name._
```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=[DATABASE_NAME];uid=[USERNAME];pwd=[PASSWORD];"
  }
}
```
* _Run the terminal command ```dotnet ef database update``` to create the initial MySQL database._

#### To Run the API:
* _Navigate to this project's production directory named "TravelApi"._
* _Run ```dotnet watch run``` in the command line to run the API from your local port. This will also open up Swagger UI in your browser. At this point, you can begin making API calls._
* _To make a test a get request, click on the "Get" reviews route in the Swagger UI, then click the "try it out" button._
* _Reference the endpoint urls, optional parameters, and example requests listed below. The TravelAPI supports Get, Post, Update, and Delete functionality._

## Endpoints
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/{v1/v2}/reviews/
GET http://localhost:5000/api/{v1/v2}/reviews/{id}
POST http://localhost:5000/api/{v1/v2}/reviews/
PUT http://localhost:5000/api/{v1/v2}/reviews/{id}
DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/{v1/v2}/reviews/{id}
```
Note: `{id}` is a variable and it should be replaced with the id number of the review you want to GET, PUT, or DELETE.
Note: `{v1/v2}` indicates the version of the API you want to use. Version 2 contains all functionality of version 1 but also includes pagination for Get results.
